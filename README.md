## My proccess
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM
- SASS
- JavaScript
- Intersection Observer API
- Webpack

### Highlights / Features
   - First time using `Webpack`. Probably there are some mistakes with the related files. Iâ€™ve been struggling a lot with that so probably it is not the most efficient way to do it. 
   - I added some animation to the header when site is loaded.
   - I added a sticky nav bar. I used `Intersection Observer API` to do it.
